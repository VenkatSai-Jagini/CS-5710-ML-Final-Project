Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning
We have created this project to perform sales prediction on the Black Friday Sales data. We have done our analysis using 3 Major and popular Machine Learning Algorithms namely Linear Regresion, Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost Regressor. We have Compared the results for all those 3 Algorithms and determined that XGBoost Works best for this Black Friday Sales Dataset.
